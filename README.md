### Target Prices

Target prices are estimates of the future price of a stock. They are typically set by analysts based on their assessment of the company's fundamentals, such as its earnings growth potential, competitive landscape, and financial health.

### Letter Grades

Letter grades are a way for analysts to communicate their overall opinion on a stock. They are typically assigned on a scale of A to F, with A being the most bullish and F being the most bearish.

## Getting Started

To get started with the "Target Price Listing" project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the backend API server.
3. Set up the frontend application.
4. Run the project locally.
5. Explore the target prices and letters for popular stocks.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture with the following structure:

- `backend/`: Contains the Express.js API server (accessible at http://localhost:5000).
- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend application (accessible at http://localhost:3000).

## Backend

The backend of the project is built using Node.js and Express.js. It serves the API endpoints to retrieve the target prices and letters data. The backend is accessible at http://localhost:5000.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/target-prices`: Retrieves the target prices and letters listing.

## Frontend

The frontend of the project is a React application built with TypeScript and Material-UI. It fetches and displays the target prices and letters data from the backend API. The frontend is accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

1. Start the backend API server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```
````

2. Start the frontend application:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

3. Access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## To-Do List and Upcoming Features

This project has successfully been deployed to Heroku. Here are the next steps and upcoming features that we plan to implement:

1. **Editing Row Items**: We plan to enable users to edit the content of each row item (e.g., stock, target price, and letter status) directly within the table. This will provide an easy way for users to update the information as needed.

2. **Dropdown for Letter Status**: The "Letter" status in each row will be replaced with a dropdown menu, allowing users to select the appropriate letter status from the available options (e.g., Buy, Hold, Sell).

3. **Edit Dialog Form**: When a user clicks on a row or a button next to the letter status, an edit dialog form will open. This dialog form will contain fields for updating the stock, target price, and letter status. Users can make their changes and save them.

4. **Edit API Endpoint**: We'll create a new API endpoint for editing row items. When users make changes via the dialog form, the data will be sent to this endpoint to update the database.

Stay tuned for these exciting updates as we continue to enhance and refine this application!
