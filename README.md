### Target Prices

Target prices are estimates of the future price of a stock. They are typically set by analysts based on their assessment of the company's fundamentals, such as its earnings growth potential, competitive landscape, and financial health.

### Letter Grades

Letter grades are a way for analysts to communicate their overall opinion on a stock. They are typically assigned on a scale of A to F, with A being the most bullish and F being the most bearish.
